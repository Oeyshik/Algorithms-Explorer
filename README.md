## Publishing the Chrome Extension (Free)

Follow these steps to publish the Chrome extension for free on the Chrome Web Store:

**Prerequisites:**
- A Google account to publish an extension.
- Ensure your extension is properly developed, tested, and ready for public use.

**Step 1: Prepare the Extension**

Before publishing, make sure the extension is complete, well-tested, and adheres to Chrome's policies. Test it thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.

**Step 2: Package the Extension**

1. Create a `.zip` file containing all the necessary files for the extension. This typically includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, manifest.json, and any assets like icons or images.

2. Make sure manifest.json file is correctly configured with the necessary permissions, icons, and other settings.

**Step 3: Create a Developer Account**

1. Visit the [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/).

2. Sign in with your Google account if not already logged in.

3. Click the "Developer agreement" link and read and accept the terms.

**Step 4: Upload the Extension**

1. After accepting the developer agreement, click the "Add a new item" button.

2. Upload the `.zip` file containing your extension.

3. Fill out the details for the extension, including the title, description, screenshots, and other metadata. It has to be made sure to provide clear and concise information to attract users.

4. Set pricing options to "Free."

5. Click the "Publish item" button.

**Step 5: Review Process**

Google will review the extension to ensure it complies with their policies. This review process may take a few hours to a few days.

**Step 6: Publish Your Extension**

Once the extension passes the review, it will be published on the Chrome Web Store, and users can start installing it.

**Step 7: Manage Updates**

It is possible release updates to your extension through the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard. It has to be made sure to maintain and improve extension based on user feedback and any issues that arise.

Please note that while there is a one-time registration fee of $5, it is not required for me at this time.

That's it! The Chrome extension is now published for free on the Chrome Web Store, and users can start installing and using it without any cost.
